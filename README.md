# ARA â€“ Advanced assembly-like language for reversible computing

ARA is an experimental reversible programming language, designed as an abstraction layer for low-level reversible programming.
In its core it is based on RSSA, but aims to provide a better user-experience by omitting some of the SSA restrictions.

The main features of ARA include:
- A simple type system including structures.
- Routine-level scopes for variables.
- Dataflow-based detection of reversibility violations.

In its current state, ARA is still under development.
The compiler interface, error messages, semantics and syntax are therefore prone to change.
